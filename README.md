# LetterOpenerDb

**LetterOpenerDb** is a Ruby gem that intercepts outgoing emails in your Rails application and stores them in a database for easy viewing, searching, and debugging. Inspired by [letter_opener](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener), this gem provides a convenient web interface instead of relying on local file system storage.

## Motivation

While the original **letter_opener** gem saves emails as files, it has several limitations:

1. **No Search Functionality**: Storing emails on the file system makes them difficult to search.
2. **Server Scalability Issues**: If you run multiple servers (e.g., on a staging environment), emails are scattered across different file systems, making it impossible to view all captured emails in one place.

To address these issues, **LetterOpenerDb** saves the emails in a database, enabling:

- **Search** by subject, body, or other fields
- **Centralized Access** to all emails, even in multi-server environments

## Features

- **Database Storage**  
  All emails sent by ActionMailer are recorded in the database.
- **Web Interface**  
  Easily browse and inspect sent emails through an embedded Rails engine.
- **Simple Search**  
  Search by text in the subject or body of emails.
- **Rails Engine**  
  Includes models, controllers, and views for quick installation and easy maintenance.
